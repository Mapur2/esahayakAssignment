## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

4. Initialize the database:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Database Setup

The app uses SQLite with Drizzle ORM. The database file will be created automatically at `./local.db`.

#### Available Database Commands:

- `npm run db:generate` - Generate migration files
- `npm run db:migrate` - Run migrations
- `npm run db:push` - Push schema changes to database
- `npm run db:studio` - Open Drizzle Studio (database GUI)

### Buyer History Table
- `id` (UUID) - Primary key
- `buyerId` (UUID) - Foreign key to buyers
- `changedBy` (string) - User who made the change
- `changedAt` (timestamp)
- `diff` (JSON) - Details of what changed

## Pages & Features

### 1. Login (`/login`)

## Validation & Safety

### Client-Side Validation
- Real-time form validation using Zod schemas
- Conditional field requirements
- Budget constraint validation
- Phone number format validation

### Server-Side Validation
- All form submissions validated with Zod
- Database constraints enforced
- Ownership checks for edit/delete operations
- Concurrency control with optimistic locking

### Security Features
- Session-based authentication
- Ownership-based access control
- Input sanitization and validation
- SQL injection protection via ORM

## CSV Import/Export

### Import
- Supports CSV files with headers
- Validates each row individually
- Shows detailed error messages for invalid rows
- Transactional import (all or nothing)
- Maximum 200 rows per import

### Export
- Exports current filtered results
- Includes all lead data
- Timestamped filename
- Respects current search and filter state

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Test Coverage
- Validation schema tests
- Form validation logic
- Budget constraint validation
- CSV import validation

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy

### Environment Variables for Production
```bash
DATABASE_URL="libsql://your-production-database-url"
```

## Design Decisions

### Database Choice
- **SQLite**: Chosen for simplicity and local development
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations with excellent TypeScript support
- **Migrations**: Proper schema versioning and deployment

### Authentication
- **Simple Session Auth**: Demo implementation for assignment requirements
- **Production Ready**: Easy to replace with NextAuth.js or similar

### Validation Strategy
- **Zod Schemas**: Shared validation between client and server
- **Form Libraries**: React Hook Form for better UX
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and validation

### State Management
- **Server Components**: Leveraging Next.js App Router for SSR
- **URL State**: Filters and search synced with URL for bookmarking
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with rollback on errors
